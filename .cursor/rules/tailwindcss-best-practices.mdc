# Best practices for using Tailwind CSS

- Always use Tailwind CSS classes over custom CSS for consistency and maintainability
- Use Tailwind's utility-first approach to create responsive and customizable UI components
- Organize Tailwind classes in a logical order (e.g., layout, spacing, typography, colors)
- Use Tailwind's @apply directive to create reusable component styles
- Keep your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js) organized and well-documented
