# Best practices for unit testing

- Always use a behavior-driven development approach for more resilient and useful test cases
- Keep tests focused on specific behaviors or functionalities
- Use descriptive names for test suites and individual test cases
- Prefer stubs for logical dependencies (ie services, especially those that use http)
- when stubbing services the stub methods should return mocked (or recorded) data to keep tests using life like data and scenarios
- Mock dependencies only when necessary, but avoid mocking data in the code itself
- Never change logic code to make a test pass unless following test-driven development and the logic is 100% wrong; always consult with the user before making such changes
