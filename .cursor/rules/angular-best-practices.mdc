description: Best practices and guidelines for Angular development

- Always use standalone components for better modularity and performance
- Never use Angular Modules; they are deprecated in favor of standalone components
- Always separate HTML, CSS, and TypeScript into individual files for better maintainability
- Always use OnPush ChangeDetection strategy for improved performance
- Always use signals and signal-based functions like input() and output() for reactive state management
- Manage state using Angular signals and ngrx signalState for a consistent and scalable approach
- Always lazy-load components and routes that are not the first ones loaded for a page to optimize initial load time
- Always use static routes files for better performance and easier maintenance
