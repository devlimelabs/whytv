# Best practices for using async/await syntax

- Always prefer async/await syntax over Promises or callbacks for better readability
- Use try/catch blocks to handle errors in async functions
- Only use await when the result is needed immediately or before the next code executes
- Be mindful of performance when using multiple awaits in a single function
